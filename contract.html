	<h1>Catalin Feraru WEB110-01 Course Contract</h1>
</header>	
<main>
	<p>I, <a href= "introduction.html">Catalin Feraru</a> agree to abide by the
	terms of the course contract in my 
	Fall 2019 WEB110-01 Internet/Web Fundamentals
	with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen
	</p>
	
	
	<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website
	will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there
	that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
	</p>
	
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, 
	not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
	may show as absences.
	</p>
